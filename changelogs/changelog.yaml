  2.0.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - configuration_item - Added name as a unique identifier. This means that the
        idempotence is based on name, while previously there was no idempotence (except
        for sys_id). When state=present if a configuration item with given name does
        not exist, the item is created. If it already exists, it is updated. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/servicenow.itsm/pull/192)
      - plugins/inventory/now.py - Removed parameters ``ansible_host_source``, ``named_groups``
        and ``group_by`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/servicenow.itsm/pull/213).
      bugfixes:
      - modules/problem.py - Uses I(API for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Certified
        Content Collection) Scripted REST API Service for transitioning problem state
        in case of Table API fails.
      minor_changes:
      - Attachment integration tests - Add missing register variables (https://github.com/ansible-collections/servicenow.itsm/pull/194)
      - TableClient - Remove hardcoded value of sysparm_exclude_reference_link when
        querying on table api.
      - \*_info modules - Added additional module parameter sysparm_display_value
        to all info modules, which, if set to either true or all, enables the user
        to see the values of sys_tags.
      - \*_info modules - Added field sysparm_query, which represents an encoded query
        string used to filter the results as an alternative to C(query) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/servicenow.itsm/pull/190).
      - api - Added module api, which essentially codifies the ServiceNow REST API
        explorer in Ansible-native way for POST, PATCH and DELETE operations.
      - api - Enhanced api module with template processing capabilities as an alternative
        to its data parameter for creating or updating a resource (https://github.com/ansible-collections/servicenow.itsm/pull/201).
      - api_info - Added module api_info, which essentially codifies the ServiceNow
        REST API explorer in Ansible-native way for retrieving records (GET operations).
      - attachment integration tests - Adapt integration tests for attachment module
        due to changes on PR 192 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/servicenow.itsm/pull/193)
      - configuration_batch_item - now returns result instead only if something was
        changed or not.
      - configuration_item_info - Added option name to simplify queries based on that
        parameter.
      - module_utils/attachments.py - Add ``get_attachment`` and ``save_attachment``
        (https://github.com/ansible-collections/servicenow.itsm/pull/186).
      - module_utils/problem.py - Added problem client for requesting problem state
        updates from the I(API for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Certified Content
        Collection) Scripted REST API Service.
      - module_utils/util.py - Added optional Boolean parameter C(implicit) to C(get_mapper)
        function to provide default values for missing keys in the mapping.
      - modules/problem.py - Added module parameters validation to match the mapping
        specification.
      - modules/problem.py - Added optional module parameter C(base_api_path) to control
        the URI prefix of the endpoint exposed by the I(API for Red Hat Ansible Automation
        Platform Certified Content Collection) Scripted REST API Service.
      - now - Added field sysparm_query, which represents an encoded query string
        used to filter the results as an alternative to C(query) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/servicenow.itsm/pull/190).
      - test_api - Remove unused import which caused sanity error. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/servicenow.itsm/pull/204)

  2.1.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - inventory plugin - sysparm_query attribute is taken into account.
      - mapping - When creating custom mapping, one can list unknown fields and map
        them to values. Before the fix there was a bug, where one could only rename
        fields inside mapping.
      minor_changes:
      - api - Added parameter query_params to api module (https://github.com/ansible-collections/servicenow.itsm/pull/225).

        'compose' block.
